# Pyth Price Feed Updater

## Purpose

The Pyth Price Feed Updater is designed to fulfill the essential role of updating Pyth price feeds in your decentralized application. While Pyth officially updates some feeds themselves, most Pyth price feeds require an external service to ensure that they remain current and accurate. This updater service handles that responsibility, automatically retrieving the latest price data from the Pyth network and updating your application’s price feeds accordingly. By doing so, it ensures that your smart contracts have access to the most up-to-date price information, reducing the need for manual updates and helping to maintain the reliability and accuracy of your financial operations.

## Overview

Our Pyth Price Feed Updater is a managed white-glove solution utilizing the same network that's used to update our oracles.

## Configuration

### Feed-specific

Every price feed supports updates based on either:
1. The price changing by at least the specified threshold (See [Update Thresholds](/misc/update-thresholds))
2. The heartbeat period being met (i.e. requiring at least one update every so often)

Every feed also supports confirmation periods and delays. I.e. Only perform an update if it's been needed for over a set amount of time.

### Gas spend

A variety of gas-related parameters can be adjusted, or we can tune them for you.

For those looking for controls on cost or performance, the following parameters can be adjusted:
- Min gas price
- Max gas price
- Transaction types
- Gas price multipliers
- EIP-1559 related parameters:
  - Base fee multipliers
  - Tip multipliers
  - Custom gas pricing algorithm parameters:
    - Percentile
    - Number of historical blocks to consider in the algorithm
- And more!

If more controls are needed, feel free to reach out!

## Analytics

We provide two ways to analyze performance of your managed service:
1. A data analytics dashboard
