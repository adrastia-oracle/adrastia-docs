# Automatos v0

## Introduction

Automatos v0 is the automation system built to power the Adrastia oracle contracts with a focus on reliability and speed. Since it began development in 2021, it has been expanded for a variety of purposes: in-house oracle systems, trade fulfillment, Pyth price feed updaters, Chainlink Data Streams updaters, and more.

## Pre-Built Services

In addition to servicing all of our oracle systems and controllers as described in this documentation site, we offer the following pre-built services:

- [Pyth Price Feed Updater](/automatos/pyth-price-feed-updater)
- [Chainlink Data Streams Updater](/automatos/chainlink-data-streams-feed-updater)
- General Automation: We're ready to automate any contract implementing AutomationCompatibleInterface

## Custom Services

We're happy to build custom automation solutions, so please reach out to us via email ([support@adrastia.io](mailto:support@adrastia.io)) or [Discord](https://discord.adrastia.io). As an example, we built custom automated trade fulfillment for [Oku](https://oku.trade).
