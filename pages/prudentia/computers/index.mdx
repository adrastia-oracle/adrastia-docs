# Computers

## Overview

Prudentia Computers are smart contracts that plug into various Prudentia Controllers to provide specific computation logic.

## Interface

All Prudentia Computers implement the following interface:

```solidity
/**
 * @title IRateComputer
 * @notice An interface that defines a contract that computes rates.
 */
interface IRateComputer {
    /// @notice Computes the rate for a token.
    /// @param token The address of the token to compute the rate for.
    /// @return rate The rate for the token.
    function computeRate(address token) external view returns (uint64);
}
```
