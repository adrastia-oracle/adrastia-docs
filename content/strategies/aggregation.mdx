# Oracle Aggregation Strategies

## Implementations

### Minimum

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates the [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum) price and the total liquidity of the observations.

- Contract: [`MinimumAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/MinimumAggregator.sol)

### Maximum

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates the [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum) price and the total liquidity of the observations.

- Contract: [`MaximumAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/MaximumAggregator.sol)

### Median

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) price and the total liquidity of the observations.

- Contract: [`MedianAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/MedianAggregator.sol)

### Weighted mean (average)

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates weighted mean price and the total liquidity of the observations. By default, the weight of each observation is 1, making this a simple average.

- Contract: [`MeanAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/MeanAggregator.sol)

#### Token weighted mean

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates the mean price weighted by the token liquidity of each observation, and the total liquidity of the observations.

- Contract: [`TokenWeightedMeanAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/TokenWeightedMeanAggregator.sol)

#### Quote token weighted mean

An observation aggregation strategy that calculates the mean price weighted by the quote token liquidity of each observation, and the total liquidity of the observations.

- Contract: [`QuoteTokenWeightedMeanAggregator`](https://github.com/adrastia-oracle/adrastia-core/blob/main/contracts/strategies/aggregation/QuoteTokenWeightedMeanAggregator.sol)
