# Permissions

Many of our contracts are permissioned to allow for configuration changes, updater (reporter) restriction management, and more.

Our web app conveniently displays the permissioning of each contract, allowing you to easily see who has the ability to make changes to the contract. Simply click on the "Learn More" button on the contract card to view the permissions.
